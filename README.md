# Hyperparameter Optimizer

A lightweight and flexible Python library for hyperparameter tuning using metaheuristic techniques.  
Currently, the library includes **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)** and **Pattern Search (PS)** only.

Designed for Scikit-learn-compatible models, this package offers an easy-to-use interface for optimizing model performance in just a few lines.

## üöÄ Quickstart

Here's a basic example of how to use **Hyperparameter Optimizer** with a Scikit-learn model (e.g., `RandomForestClassifier`):

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from hyperparameter_optimizer import HyperparameterOptimizer

# Load data
X, y = load_iris(return_X_y=True)

# Define parameter space
param_space = {
    'n_estimators': [],
    'max_depth': [],
    'criterion': []
}

# Initialize the optimizer
optimizer = HyperparameterOptimizer(
                                        obj_func=RandomForestClassifier(),
                                        params=param_space,
                                        scoring='accuracy',
                                        opt_type='max',
                                        cv=3,
                                        verbose=1
                                    )

# Run optimization
# [1] Particle Swarm Optimization
particles, Gbest_history, Gbest_pos, Gbest_score = optimizer.optimizePSO(
                                                                            features = X,
                                                                            target = y,
                                                                            nParticles = 10,
                                                                            bounds = [(10, 1000), (1, 10), ['gini', 'entropy']],
                                                                            maxIter = 10
                                                                    )
print("Best Params:", Gbest_pos)
print("Best Score:", Gbest_score)

# [2] Pattern Search Optimization
Gbest_history2, Gbest_pos2, Gbest_score2 = optimizer.optimizePS(
                                                                    features = X,
                                                                    target = y,
                                                                    bounds = [(10, 1000), (1, 10), ['gini', 'entropy']],
                                                                    mesh_size_coeff = 0.1,
                                                                    acc_coeff = 1,
                                                                    contr_coeff = 0.50,
                                                                    maxIter = 10
                                                            )
print("Best Params:", Gbest_pos2)
print("Best Score:", Gbest_score2)

## üß† How It Works

This library leverages two optimization techniques‚Äî**Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Pattern Search (PS)**‚Äîto explore the hyperparameter space effectively.

    Particle Swarm Optimization simulates a group of particles (candidate solutions) moving through the search space. Each particle adjusts its position based on its own best-known position and the best-known position among its peers, enabling a balance between exploration and exploitation as the swarm converges toward an optimal solution.

    Pattern Search is a derivative-free method that explores the neighborhood of a current solution by systematically evaluating a set of search directions. If an improved solution is found, the algorithm moves in that direction and repeats the process, enabling efficient local refinement without relying on gradient information.

Together, these methods provide robust global and local search capabilities for hyperparameter tuning.
